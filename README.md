The Smart Garbage System is an innovative waste management solution that utilizes two ultrasonic sensors to detect the levels of dry and wet waste in two separate garbage bins. The collected data is transmitted over Firebase database, allowing for easy access via an Android app. 
 
The system is integrated with a local web server hosted on the IP address displayed in the serial monitor in Arduino IDE, enabling users to access the data even without the Android app. This was accomplished using NodeMCU.  

The Smart Garbage System is a practical and efficient way to manage waste disposal, providing users with real-time data to prevent overflowing bins and unpleasant odors. It is suitable for households, businesses, and communities looking to streamline their waste management practices.
